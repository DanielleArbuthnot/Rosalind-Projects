# Rosalind-Projects
This is a series of bioinformatics problems by Rosalind I have solved, and that I think showcase my programming ability. As a novice beginner programmer I am using this to improve my programming ability and confidence in the field of bioinformatics, and to find out which areas of bioinformatics I enjoy.  

Rosalind is a website encouraging the learning of bioinformatics through the solving of problems that may be encountered in the real world. For more information please visit their webiste: https://rosalind.info/about/
